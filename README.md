# Python100DaysJourney_Jhonlloydval
Welcome to my 100 Days to Python journey! This is based from Angela Yu's Python bootcamp. This repository serves as a structured learning path where I document my progress in Python programming, day by day. Each day comes with its own set of notes, projects, and tasks that reflect my learning milestones and coding challenges.

**Repository Structure:**
Day X folders: Each day has its own dedicated folder that includes 
1. Notes : The Key takeaways, concepts, note taking, and any other important stuff especially about syntax or libraries
2. Projects : Mini-projects that implement the day's concept, ranging from basic tasks to capstone projects based on the Bootcamp's curriculum. I have a lot of file on this section since I also save drafts, other solutions, and the main solution.
3. Tasks : These includes the coding exercises and challenges that reinforces my learning on the certain day
